  description: Training modern LLMs is extremely resource intensive, and customizing them for various deployment scenarios characterized by limited compute and memory resources through repeated training is impractical. We introduce Flextron, a network architecture and post-training model optimization framework supporting flexible model deployment.

- title: "Step Out and Seek Around: On Warm-Start Training with Incremental Data"
  image: StepOut.png
  description: We propose Knowledge Consolidation and Acquisition (CKCA), a continuous model improvement algorithm with two novel components. First, a novel feature regularization (FeatReg) to retain and refine knowledge from existing checkpoints; Second, we propose adaptive knowledge distillation (AdaKD), a novel approach to forget mitigation and knowledge transfer.

- title: "X-VILA: Cross-Modality Alignment for Large Language Model"
  image: X-VILA.png
  description: We introduce X-VILA, an omni-modality model designed to extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating image, video, and audio modalities. By aligning modality-specific encoders with LLM inputs and diffusion decoders with LLM outputs, X-VILA achieves cross-modality understanding, reasoning, and generation. To facilitate this cross-modality alignment, we curate an effective interleaved any-to-any modality instruction-following dataset.
